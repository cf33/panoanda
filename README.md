# Panoanda
Panoanda is a Pandas framework for OANDA API V1. 

## Installation

1. You can use this framework only if you have a "legacy" OANDA account (live or demo). (V20 not included)

2. You need to create a new enviroment with 2 enviroment variables ->  "ACCOUNT" and "TOKEN". If you use [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/ ) you can follow these steps : [Managing environments](https://conda.io/docs/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html)

3. Activate your enviroment and execute this code in your terminal:

    ```
    $ pip install git+https://github.com/dariocorral/panoanda.git   --process-dependency-links
    ````

 It will install all required packages.
